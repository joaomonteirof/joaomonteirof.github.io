# About Me

I am a fourth year PhD candidate at the [Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique](http://www.inrs.ca/) in Montreal, advised by [Prof. Tiago Falk](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=_i58BPYAAAAJ&hl=en). My thesis topic lies on the applications of neural networks to the verification problem. The verification problem consists of determining whether sets of examples belong to the same class, i.e. performing 2-sample tests over class conditional distributions, often under small samples. Moreover, classes seen at test time might have never been presented to the model at train time. As an example, we are interested in problems such as speaker verification, in which case we are given two audio clips and have to determine whether they were uttered by the same speaker even if the models were never presented to any audio from those speakers. In the more challenging evaluation conditions, the test recordings appear also in a different language relative to the train data.

Our most recent contributions to this field range from more practical approaches such as designing training schemes and model architectures yielding better representations in terms of downstream performance, as well as more principled approaches where we showed discriminative settings can be used to approximate test statistics frequently used under generative verification.

Besides the verification setting briefly described, further machine learning topics which interest me include:

* Out-of-distribution learning: Domain invariant/conditional models.
* Robust learning.
* Few-shot classification.
* Multi-modal approaches, e.g. models for audiovisual data, Image+Text, and so on.
